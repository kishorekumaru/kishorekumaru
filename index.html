			    <span class="heading1">Me?</span><br>
				I am Kishore kumar shortly known as KK, Barely I was a chemist, later these computer technologies drew me strongly. If you spend enough time around here, you will notice that I have a passion for life.
				
				A mild Music always relaxes me. Apart from development I love photography, I do design, video &amp; audio editing. If I get free time I do play video games.
				
				I am always been a contemplative person, hunger on learning new things.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<span class="heading1"> Where (do) I start </span><br>
				
				My childhood was delicate, I was a frail boy, not much into sports and outdoor activities. I have an huge crush on science: Inventions, space, astronomy, electronic devices, nuclear science bla bla bla.... so fascinated to explore new inventions.
				
				I believe myself to be lucky being a part of this generation. Where the whole science changed the mechanical world into a digital. I seen movies on a CRT, communicated to my friends via post, telegraphs and trunk calls, friends and families were connected without cellphones and social network.  
				
				It is interesting to see the world now but worried about I cant get back those good old days.
				</p>
				
				<p>
				<span class="heading1">Me Technically</span> <br>
				With 8 years of experience in Software Industry, currently I designated myself as senior engineer.  I spend my days writing Actionscript, MXML or writing code in other languages like HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, PHP, Dojo, Angular JS or writing SQL Queries.  
				I worked in Bangalore with India's top most MNC's like CSC, Symphony and IBM.
				
				I have a passionate on gaming technologies, due to some circumstances I still identified as a web developer. 
				
				I have created simple 2D and 3D games using Actionscript, VB, Away 3D SDK's. I also worked on cryEngine and unity platforms. I am fanatic towards modern technologies, I explored most of the 3D software's like 3Ds Max, Maya, Blender, Bryce 3D, 4D Cinema &amp; Poser.
				Since photography as a hobby, I also enhanced my skills in designing and made myself as an expert in Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects and animating objects in Flash.
				
				Whatever it is I love to code and crack complex things, So before I start, I try to repeat these three things
				
				1.Ask questions again and again until I get the exact mind set of what my client wants.
				2.Follow the client whether I doing what he wants
				3.I meant to deliver a world class product. No matter if its worth less than a dollar.
				</p>
				
				<p> 				
				<span class="heading1"> Me Personally </span><br>
				
				Hope the above all explains what I am by person :)
